There is only one rational explanation for that. When you are offering to the other side something extremely valuable at no or very little cost, there is no reason for the other side to refuse. <br/><br/>So, Mr. Trump's goal of his ""private"" meeting is simple: convince Mr. Kim that it is good for both sides to go out and tell the rest of the world that they have reached an important historical agreement (""historical"" will become the new mantra).

They will declare an end to the Korean war - which, in practical terms, means very little - and agreement to negotiate denuclearization of Korean Peninsula (whatever that means!) and work out all the issues between the two countries. <br/><br/>And then, in preparation for the up-coming election, Mr. Trump will be putting his propaganda machine (which includes FOX News and friends) into high gears to sell ""his historical achievement"" to the US public and the rest of the world.","1528734010","1528736110",284,4,TRUE,"comment",0,NA,"27419055",0,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/trump-kim-summit.html"

The predecessor's governments had a hard line policy toward North Korea because of North Korean provocations as opposed to Moon's current policy of appeasement. They are treated like an enemy of Moon's and North Korean regimes. Also under Moon's government South Korean news media are afraid to voice opposing views, causing people to turn away from major newspapers and TV news. Don't be fooled by Moon's smiling face and nice talk. He has a hidden goal of transforming free, democratic South Korea into a society like the North.

However, lest we get our hopes too high for this planned first meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, it is important to remember that achieving peace in Korea will require many meetings over months or even years, followed by ongoing maintenance, tweaks to goals and terms, and endless cycles of verification. <br/><br/>I am concerned that Trump, for reasons of personality, temperament and politics, seems to be looking for a “quick win.” By contrast, Kim, with the backing of China, is playing a much longer game, knowing that any agreement reached today can be altered or voided tomorrow. Even if Trump makes it through two terms of office, Kim will likely still be in power long after Trump is gone. The differences in outlooks between Trump and Kim creates a real risk that Kim will grant Trump short-term baubles in exchange for real long-term benefits. <br/><br/>My second biggest concern is that by focusing solely on North Korea’s military hardware, we are neglecting the potentially bigger threats of their cyber technologies.

However, lest we get our hopes too high for this planned first meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, it is important to remember that achieving peace in Korea will require many meetings over months or even years, followed by ongoing maintenance, tweaks to goals and terms, and endless cycles of verification. <br/><br/>I am concerned that Trump, for reasons of personality, temperament and politics, seems to be looking for a “quick win.” By contrast, Kim, with the backing of China, is playing a much longer game, knowing that any agreement reached today can be altered or voided tomorrow. Even if Trump makes it through two terms of office, Kim will likely still be in power long after Trump is gone. The differences in outlooks between Trump and Kim creates a real risk that Kim will grant Trump short-term baubles in exchange for real long-term benefits. <br/><br/>My second biggest concern is that by focusing solely on North Korea’s military hardware, we are neglecting the potentially bigger threats of their cyber technologies. Times and technologies have changed since the Cold War. Military hardware costs crazy amounts of money, and a country cannot feasibly use nuclear weapons without committing suicide.

However, lest we get our hopes too high for this planned first meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, it is important to remember that achieving peace in Korea will require many meetings over months or even years, followed by ongoing maintenance, tweaks to goals and terms, and endless cycles of verification. <br/><br/>I am concerned that Trump, for reasons of personality, temperament and politics, seems to be looking for a “quick win.” By contrast, Kim, with the backing of China, is playing a much longer game, knowing that any agreement reached today can be altered or voided tomorrow. Even if Trump makes it through two terms of office, Kim will likely still be in power long after Trump is gone. The differences in outlooks between Trump and Kim creates a real risk that Kim will grant Trump short-term baubles in exchange for real long-term benefits. <br/><br/>My second biggest concern is that by focusing solely on North Korea’s military hardware, we are neglecting the potentially bigger threats of their cyber technologies.

Back in the 13th century, Mongol-ruled China itself seized Korea and ruled it for a century.<br/><br/>For long periods afterwards, China was more of a benign neighbor and protector of Korea until Japan's might ousted China as a force in Korean politics in 1895. To make matters more complicated, Imperial Russia became a strategic player in peninsular politics from the 1880s onwards until it too was ousted as a result of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. After WW2, of course, as we all know, the new big powers impinging on Korea in both destructive and benign ways have been the U.S. , the PRC, the Soviet Union, and its successor, the Russian Federation.<br/><br/> All this should make us appreciate the delicate though separate balancing acts that both Koreas have had to perform for security, survival and economic progress.

The facts of the meeting - the concrete results - they don't matter in the slightest to Trump's base. As for the world being safer today, that is a dangerous misreading of the summit. Trump is no more or less likely to order a strike on North Korea than he was last week. If we know one thing about Donald Trump, it's that, moment to moment, his actions are calculated solely on what might make him look good, or enrich him. His word is, and this cannot be stressed enough, completely worthless. I understand that the media is duty bound to report and comment on what he says because he is president of the United States, but his words are meaningless. It's not only that he lies continuously, it's that he is ruled by his whims and those whims are prone to change at any time.<br/><br/>I'm saying that Trump's photo op with Kim was a ratings smash, and that is the only thing Trump wanted from it.

The facts of the meeting - the concrete results - they don't matter in the slightest to Trump's base. As for the world being safer today, that is a dangerous misreading of the summit. Trump is no more or less likely to order a strike on North Korea than he was last week. If we know one thing about Donald Trump, it's that, moment to moment, his actions are calculated solely on what might make him look good, or enrich him. His word is, and this cannot be stressed enough, completely worthless. I understand that the media is duty bound to report and comment on what he says because he is president of the United States, but his words are meaningless. It's not only that he lies continuously, it's that he is ruled by his whims and those whims are prone to change at any time.<br/><br/>I'm saying that Trump's photo op with Kim was a ratings smash, and that is the only thing Trump wanted from it.

None of them.  More to the point, Trump has stated that his ""concessions"" are contingent on North Korea actually doing what Trump says they will do.  If North Korea doesn't do what Trump says they will do, does Mr Kristof seriously think Trump will not immediately resume military exercises, double the sanctions and threaten fire and fury?<br/><br/>Of course he will.  <br/><br/>The reality is that Trump is trying a new approach.  Ironically, so did President Obama try a new approach with Iran.  Neither approach was consistent with the years of failed negotiating tactics that preceded it.  Both were castigated for their efforts.

It will have to be done gradually, with US inspectors on hand. Kim will gladly agree to these terms, because he gets to retain political power in NK. Ten years down the road Kim will still have political power, some nukes, the ability to build more nukes and economic power. NK products will be in US stores and in our homes.

But when Brooks writes that conservatives became ""so besotted with the power of the market that they forgot what capitalism is like when it's not balanced by strong communities,"" he seems to be repeating the theme he goes to so often -- that in the main it is strong personal relationships and local institutions like faith-based communities that have made our country great.  I am all for strong personal relationships and institutions that help us to see beyond ourselves and consider a greater good, but it is not the disappearance of community that has sent us on a downward spiral. It is the debasement of government and regulation that has destroyed community.<br/><br/>Is it really untrammeled meritocracy that divides societies between the fittest and the rest, or is it untrammeled ruthlessness?  I have no doubt that the arrogance and narrow vision of some the the highly-educated in our society is a problem, but the bigger problem is the mindset that imagines regulations are simply obstacles to progress. Usurious interest rates, slave wages, environmental pollution and health care and quality education only for the rich, are what we can expect when regulations disappear. Community doesn't just happen; it is built. Shared laws are a big part of what creates the shared values that can then lead to the loyalty and affection Brooks posits.","1528802459","1528807462",517,8,TRUE,"comment",0,NA,"27430420",0,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/opinion/g7-trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-foreign-policy.html"

Better to leave that kind of thing to Russia and its ilk. It's not accurate and it's not funny. <br/><br/>I don't know Donald Trump. I've never met him personally, or spoken with him, and I never will. As I watched the first Republican debate I laughed, quite literally, at him and his hair. I thought he was an idiot and a buffoon. <br/><br/>I don't think that any more (except about his hair). I started looking into Donald Trump. I found that his opponents often exaggerated and mischaracterized what he said. I found that people who do know him well find him warm and engaging. <br/><br/>So I voted for Donald Trump, and I'm impressed with what he's done. He is different. Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump would never be mistaken for a normal, everyday human being. <br/><br/>But is that such a bad thing? Normal, everyday human beings struggle to get things done. We care too much about other people and what they think of us. We get steered away from doing what we think is right. <br/><br/>That matters, a lot. As Steve Jobs said of Barack Obama, ""I’m disappointed in Obama.
